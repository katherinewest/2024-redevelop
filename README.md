**Purpose** 

This geospatial assessment tool was developed by the 2024 REDEVELOP Program Circular Economy team. It is designed to take in information about brine lithium concentration, subsurface geothermal temperatures, and saline aquifers in the Canadian province of Alberta and produce guidance about the relative potential for co-development of these resources. 
It also takes in information about indigenous communities in Canada and seismic activity in the province of Alberta.
